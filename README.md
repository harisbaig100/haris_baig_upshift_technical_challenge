upshift technical challange

Total time spent on this challange was 4 hours Currently there is just UI for CRUD and MVP of what was asked eg (user can add, edit, delete, create post, can see all posts on main screen, a login screen, and very basic functionlity). i build an MVP due to very busy schedule. but i can build a professional one if i spent more quality time.

There a re alot of features we can add The following features can be inculded if we want to make this CRUD app more robust

1. Add translations
2. refactor the code to seprate files
3. rename variables / folders to more specific terms
4. make redux do all the CRUD work for you, (for now its just adding the post)
5. include singleton classes which will keep an eye on data
6. include multiple api retries if one failed
7. include caching mechanism for all the posts
8. use styled components
9. use firebase authentiacation
10. use drawaer library for profile drawer
11. moved duplicate code to a separate function
12. use professional technique to store and show data eg (first look in class variable, then in local db and then fetch from api whihc include retries)
13. use scroll to fetch technique on main screen which will follow the same flow eg (first look in class variable, then in local db and then fetch from api whihc include retries)
14. handle responsivness of different devices / also handle landscape mode
15. Add useful comments
16. And there is much more i can do but it depends on time, in technical interivew we can discuss this detail
